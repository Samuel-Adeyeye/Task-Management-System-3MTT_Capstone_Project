## Overview  

**TaskMaster** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline task management. It allows users to organize their tasks efficiently by creating, updating, deleting, and filtering tasks. The app integrates robust backend and frontend technologies to provide a scalable, secure, and user-friendly solution.  

---

## Features  

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using JWT or session management.  
- **Task Management**: Users can add tasks with attributes like title, description, priority, and deadline. Tasks can be updated or deleted.  
- **Filtering & Searching**: Tasks can be filtered by priority or deadline and searched by title or description.  
- **Responsive Design**: A user-friendly frontend interface with a responsive layout.  
- **Error Handling**: Robust client-side and server-side validation to ensure data integrity.  

---

## Tech Stack  

**Backend**:  
- Node.js  
- Express.js  

**Database**:  
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL  

**Frontend**:  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

**Deployment**:  
- Backend: [Fly.io](https://fly.io)  
- Frontend: [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)

## Installation and Setup  

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js  
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL installed locally or hosted  
- Git  

### Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/taskmaster.git  
   cd taskmaster  
   ```  

2. Install backend dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   cd backend  
   npm install  
   ```  

3. Configure environment variables in a `.env` file:  
   ```env  
   PORT=5000  
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/taskmaster  
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret  
   ```  

4. Start the backend server:  
   ```bash  
   npm start  
   ```  

5. Install frontend dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   cd ../frontend  
   npm install  
   ```  

6. Start the frontend development server:  
   ```bash  
   npm start  
   ```  

7. Access the app locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage  

1. Register for an account.  
2. Log in to access the task management dashboard.  
3. Add tasks by filling out the form and setting attributes like title, description, priority, and deadline.  
4. Use filters and search functionality to organize tasks.  
5. Update or delete tasks as needed.  

---

## Development Steps  

### 1. Project Planning  
Define the objectives and choose the tech stack for scalability, security, and performance optimization.  

---

### 2. Core Functionalities  
#### User Authentication  
- Implement secure login and registration with hashed passwords using bcrypt.  
- Generate and validate tokens using JWT for session management.  

#### Task Management  
- Allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks with attributes like title, description, priority, and deadline.  

#### Task Filtering & Search  
- Filter tasks by priority or deadline.  
- Implement a search bar to search by title or description.  

---

### 3. Backend Development  
- Set up an Express server to handle RESTful API routes.  
- Implement middleware for authentication and validation.  
- Use database operations to manage tasks and users.  

---

### 4. Database Design  
- **User Schema**: Stores user credentials and session information.  
- **Task Schema**: Stores task data, associated with a user via a foreign key or object ID.  

---

### 5. Frontend Development  
- Create a responsive and interactive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Use AJAX or Fetch API for seamless communication with the backend.  

---

### 6. Asynchronous Operations & Error Handling  
- Handle asynchronous operations with promises and `async/await`.  
- Validate inputs on both the frontend and backend.  

---

### 7. Testing & Deployment  
- Write unit tests for critical features like authentication and CRUD operations.  
- Deploy the backend on Fly.io and the frontend on Vercel or Netlify.
